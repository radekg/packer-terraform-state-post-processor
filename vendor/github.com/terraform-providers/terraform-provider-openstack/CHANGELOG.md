BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* Support for `default_domain` has been added. This should not cause any issues, but please report any issues encountered.
* `openstack_images_image_v2.properties` has been set to `ForceNew`. If properties are modified, the image will be recreated. Previously, updates to the properties were only happening in the Terraform state and not actually reflected on the image itself.

FEATURES

* __New Data Source__: `openstack_identity_group_v3` ([#385](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/385))
* __New Data Source__: `openstack_networking_floatingip_v2` ([#387](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/387))

IMPROVEMENTS

* Added support for `default_domain` during authentication ([#329](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/329))
* The upcoming OpenStack Rocky release will be automatically adding additional properties to the `openstack_images_image_v2` resource. This resource has been patched to account for this and to reconcile these server-provided properties with the user-provided properties. In addition, `openstack_images_image_v2.properties` has been set to `ForceNew` and will recreate the image when properties have been modified. Previously, any updates to the properties were only happening in the state and not actually reflected on the image itself. ([#390](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/390))

BUG FIXES

* The addition of the `openstack_networking_network_v2.external` data source argument caused unintended behavior of results only containing external or non-external networks. This bug has been fixed and we apologize for the inconvenience ([#384](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/384))
* The addition of the `openstack_compute_floatingip_associate_v2.wait_until_associated` argument caused the floating IP association to be recreated when updating to a later release of this provider. This was unintended and this has been resolved ([#395](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/395))

* __New Data Source__: `openstack_identity_auth_scope_v3` ([#204](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/204))

IMPROVEMENTS

* Added `verify_checksum` to `openstack_images_image_v2` resource so that checksum verification can be disabled ([#305](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/305))
* The LBaaS v2 resources have lower "delay" times when waiting for state changes. This should speed up creation of a Load Balancing stack ([#297](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/297))

BUG FIXES

* Fixed issue where `OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=2` was not recognized ([#315](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/315))
* Fixed issue when using Identity v3 resources when an Identity v2 endpoint is published ([#320](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/320))
* `openstack_networking_router_v2.distributed` will now pass `false` correctly ([#308](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/308))
* `openstack_networking_router_v2.enable_snat` will now pass `false` correctly ([#309](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/309))

## 1.4.0 (May 01, 2018)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* The OpenStack provider now has additional authentication options for `project_domain_name`, `project_domain_id`, `user_domain_name`, and `user_domain_id`. This will allow for more fine-grainted authentication scoping. This should not cause any problems with existing deployments, but please report any authentication issues after upgrading.

FEATURES

* __New Resource__: `openstack_identity_role_assignment_v3` ([#265](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/265))
* __New Data Source__: `openstack_identity_project_v3` ([#251](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/251))
* __New Data Source__: `openstack_identity_user_v3` ([#252](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/252))

IMPROVEMENTS

* Added `member_status` to `openstack_images_image_v2` data source ([#269](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/269))
* Add support for `OS_TOKEN` environment variable ([#272](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/272))
* Added `force_destroy` to `openstack_objectstorage_container_v1` which will cause all objects in the container to be deleted when the container is deleted ([#276](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/276))
* CIDR is now optional in `openstack_networking_subnet_v2` allowing a CIDR to be allocated from a subnet pool ([#294](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/294))
* Added additional authentication options for domain scoping ([#290](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/290))

BUG FIXES

* `openstack_compute_instance_v2` resources can handle Availability Zones in the format of `az:host:node` ([#291](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/291))

## 1.3.0 (March 14, 2018)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* `openstack_compute_keypair_v2` can now generate a private key, however the private key will be stored in your Terraform state. Please use caution.
* The MAC addresses in `openstack_networking_port_v2.allowed_address_pairs` is no longer computed. This should not cause an issue for users since if an `allowed_address_pairs` MAC address was not specified, the AAP MAC will match `openstack_networking_port_v2.mac_address`.

FEATURES

* __New Resource:__ `openstack_networking_subnetpool_v2` ([#243](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/243))

* Added `subnet_id` to `openstack_networking_floatingip_v2` ([#240](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/240))

BUG FIXES

* Fixed bug with `openstack_networking_network_v2` and `openstack_networking_subnet_v2` where the `OS_TENANT_ID` was incorrectly being used as a default value ([#254](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/254))
* Correctly detect if an object storage container is deleted ([#261](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/261))
* Fixed a few small bugs with `openstack_fw_rule_v1` updating ([#224](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/224))
* Fixed an issue with `openstack_networking_port_v2` `allowed_address_pairs` and MAC addresses ([#244](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/244))

## 1.2.0 (January 18, 2018)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* The way IP addresses for `allowed_address_pairs` in the `openstack_networking_port_v2` resource are stored in the Terraform state has changed. 
* The `external_gateway` argument in the `openstack_networking_router_v2` has been deprecated in favor of the more appropriately named `external_network_id`.

FEATURES

* __New Resource:__ `openstack_db_database_v1` ([#179](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/179))

* User's password field in `openstack_db_instance_v2` resource has been marked sensitive ([#220](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/220))
* `openstack_db_instance_v1` now supports setting a `configuration_id` ([#221](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/221))

BUG FIXES

* Allow the same `ip_address` with a different `mac_address` to be specified multiple times in the `openstack_networking_port_v2` resource ([#168](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/168))
* Fixed unhandled error checks which were causing crashes in `openstack_networking_secgroup_v2` and `openstack_networking_network_v2` data sources ([#201](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/201))

## 1.1.0 (December 04, 2017)

FEATURES

* __New Resource:__ `openstack_objectstorage_object_v1` ([#146](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/146))
* __New Resource:__ `openstack_db_instance_v1` ([#155](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/155))

IMPROVEMENTS

* Better handling of mutually exclusive options `no_gateway` and `gateway_ip` in the `openstack_networking_subnet_v2` resource ([#136](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/136))
* Can now authenticate with a `clouds.yaml` file ([#154](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/154))

* Fixed issue with creating public flavors ([#177](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/177))

## 1.0.0 (November 08, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* If your OpenStack cloud supports the Octavia Load Balancing service, you can now use it by setting the provider-level `use_octavia` argument to `true`. The `openstack_lb_*_v2` resources will then seamlessly use Octavia.

FEATURES

* __New Data Source:__ `openstack_networking_subnet_v2` ([#135](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/135))
* __New Data Source:__ `openstack_dns_zone_v2` ([#145](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/145))

IMPROVEMENTS

* `openstack_networking_router_v2`: Added `enable_snat` argument ([#140](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/140))
* Added provider-level option of `use_octavia` to use the Octavia load balancing service ([#149](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/149))

## 0.3.0 (October 23, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* The `openstack_networking_port_v2` resource had a significant update to how it handles security groups. If you have not explicitly defined security groups in the port resource, any security groups which were automatically applied by OpenStack (such as the `default` security group) will be removed upon the next apply. To prevent this from happening, add the ID of the security groups to the `security_group_ids` argument. If you are already explicitly specifying security groups, you should see no change in behavior.

IMPROVEMENTS

 * `openstack_networking_router_interface_v2` will now set `subnet_id` when importing ([#119](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/119))
 * `openstack_networking_router_route_v2` can now be imported ([#120](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/120))
 * `openstack_images_image_v2` resource and data source now supports reading and setting properties ([#113](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/113))

BUG FIXES

  * `openstack_networking_port_v2`: Fixed issues with how security groups and allowed address pairs are applied and updated [[#114](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/114)].

## 0.2.2 (September 15, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* Unused `id` fields in the LBaaS v2 resources were removed. This should not cause any issues, but please report if you find otherwise.

FEATURES:

* __New Data Source:__ `openstack_networking_secgroup_v2` ([#86](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/86))
* __New Resource:__: `openstack_compute_flavor_v2` ([#83](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/83))

IMPROVEMENTS
 * Added `status` field to `openstack_networking_network_v2` data source ([#105](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/105))
 * `openstack_networking_router_v2` can now be imported ([#111](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/111))
 * `openstack_networking_router_interface_v2` can now be imported ([#112](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/112))
 
BUG FIXES

* `openstack_lb_listener_v2`: Don't send `connection_limit` unless it has been set ([#90](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/90))
* `openstack_lb_pool_v2`: Find Load Balancer via Listener ([#97](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/97))

* `openstack_compute_instance_v2`: Fix regression bug with NIC detection ([#117](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/117))

## 0.2.1 (August 23, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* `openstack_lb_loadbalancer_v2` timeouts have been lowered to 10 and 5 minutes ([#74](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/74))

BUG FIXES:

* `openstack_images_image_v2` data source now sorts images by `CreatedAt` instead of `UpdatedAt` ([#78](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/78))
* `openstack_networking_secgroup_v2` now re-reads security group before deleteing rules when `delete_default_rules => true` ([#82](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/82))
* Fixed `openstack_compute_instance_v2` access IP address detection in dual-stack environments ([#85](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/85))

## 0.2.0 (August 14, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* Network detection in the `openstack_compute_instance_v2` resource was cleaned up and updated. There should be no incompatibilities, but you should do a `plan` before `apply` just to be safe.
* The `openstack_lb_loadbalancer_v2.provider` argument has been removed entirely. This was an erroneous argument from the beginning, so it should not be in use. However, if you do have it set in your configurations, please rename it to `loadbalancer_provider`.

FEATURES:

* __New Resource:__ `openstack_identity_project_v3` ([#50](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/50))
* __New Resource:__ `openstack_identity_user_v3` ([#52](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/52))

IMPROVEMENTS:

* `openstack_compute_instance_v2` now supports Neutron for network detection ([#39](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/39))
* `openstack_compute_instance_v2` support for multiple NICs on the same network ([#39](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/39))
* Added support for `TERMINATED_HTTPS` protocol in `openstack_lb_listener_v2` ([#49](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/49))
* Improvements to LBaaS v2 resource coordination ([#59](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/59))
* `openstack_lb_loadbalancer_v2.provider` has been removed. See notes above. ([#65](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/65))

* `openstack_fw_firewall_v1.associated_routers` is now computed. ([#53](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/53))
* All `openstack_fw_rule_v1` attributes are now passed during an update phase. ([#53](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/53))
* `openstack_networking_secgroup_v2` now correctly updates description. ([#60](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/60))
* `openstack_fw_firewall_v1` now correctly translates `value_specs` on create. ([#66](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/66))

## 0.1.0 (June 21, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* You can now specify `region` in the provider block. All resources will inherit this region setting, or you can override it in the resource-level `region`. Make sure to do a `plan` before an `apply` to make sure the resource is not destroyed due to incorrectly determining the region! If you see this happening, either explicitly set the `region` in the resource or use `lifecycle.ignore_changes`. 
* `floating_ip` has been removed from `openstack_compute_instance_v2`. You must now use `openstack_compute_floatingip_associate_v2` to associate a Floating IP with an Instance.
* `volume` has been removed from `openstack_compute_instance_v2`. You must now use `openstack_compute_volume_attach_v2` to attach a Volume with an Instance.
* `member` has been removed from `openstack_lb_pool_v1`. You must now use `openstack_lb_member_v1` to add a LBaaS v1 Member to a Pool.


IMPROVEMENTS:

* Can specify `region` in the provider ([#25](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/25))

BUG FIXES

* Wait for LoadBalancer to be active before creating Pools and Monitors ([#29](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/29))
* Choose first network found with a matching name for compute instances ([#36](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-openstack/issues/36))
